# UE4 Gesture Recognizers

This is an under-development set of Gesture Recognizers for doing mobile development in Unreal Engine 4. Instead of being implemented as part of the UE4 Key/Event system, these are Actor Components that can be added to any Actor. Delegate methods (accessible as blueprint nodes) inform the actor when gestures meeting the requirements are found,.
