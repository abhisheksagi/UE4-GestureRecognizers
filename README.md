# UE4 Gesture Recognizers

This is an under-development set of Gesture Recognizers for doing mobile development in Unreal Engine 4. Instead of being implemented as part of the UE4 Key/Event system, these are Actor Components that can be added to any Actor. Delegate methods (accessible as blueprint nodes) inform the actor when gestures meeting the requirements are found.

Bug fixes and additions are more than welcome.
